        <h2>What is a Solar Tracker?</h2>
        <p class="lead">A solar tracker is a device that follows the sun as it moves across the sky. When solar trackers are
            coupled with solar panels, the panels can follow the path of the sun and produce more renewable energy for
            you to use.
            Solar trackers are usually paired with ground mount solar systems but recently, rooftop-mounted trackers
            have come onto the market.
            Typically, solar tracking equipment will be connected to the racking of the solar panels. From there, the
            solar panels will be able to move along with the movement of the sun.</p>

        <h2>Solar Tracker using Arduino</h2>
        <p>A solar tracker is a device that orients solar panels, mirrors, or other devices toward the sun to maximize the
            absorption of sunlight. The main necessity of using a solar tracker, particularly one controlled by Arduino,
            lies in optimizing the efficiency and output of solar energy systems. Key reasons for using a solar tracker:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Increased Energy Harvesting Efficiency:</b>Solar panels generate the maximum power
                when they are directly facing the sun. A solar tracker ensures that the panels are always oriented
                towards the sun, maximizing the amount of sunlight they receive throughout the day. This can
                significantly increase the overall energy harvesting efficiency of a solar power system.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Enhanced Power Output:</b> By keeping solar panels aligned with the sun's position, a
                solar tracker can boost the overall power output of a solar energy system. This is particularly
                important in locations where sunlight conditions vary throughout the day and across seasons.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Optimal Angle Adjustment:</b> Solar trackers can adjust the tilt angle of solar panels to
                account for the changing position of the sun in the sky. This is crucial for capturing sunlight more
                effectively, especially in regions with a significant variation in the sun's angle throughout the day
                and across different seasons.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Adaptation to Environmental Changes: </b>Weather conditions, such as clouds or haze, can
                impact the amount of sunlight reaching solar panels. A solar tracker can dynamically adjust the
                position of the panels to adapt to these changes, maintaining optimal alignment with the sun and
                mitigating the impact of environmental factors on energy production.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Educational and DIY Projects:</b> Building a solar tracker using Arduino can be an
                educational and engaging project for students and DIY enthusiasts. It provides an opportunity to
                learn about solar energy, electronics, programming, and automation. Arduino is a popular choice for
                controlling solar trackers due to its ease of use, versatility, and affordability. By using sensors
                and actuators, an Arduino-based solar tracker can continuously monitor the position of the sun and
                adjust the orientation of the solar panels accordingly, ensuring maximum energy capture.</li>

                            Arduino family and a great choice for beginners. The Arduino hardware and software was
                            designed for artists, designers, hobbyists, hackers, newbies, and anyone interested in
                            creating interactive objects or environments. Arduino can interact with buttons, LEDs,

                            devices that convert sunlight into electricity. Integrated into the tracker, these panels
                            are dynamically adjusted to optimize their orientation, ensuring they face the sun for
                            maximum energy absorption. The solar tracker's movement, guided by sensors and control
                            systems, allows the panels to follow the sun's path throughout the day. This dynamic
                            alignment significantly improves energy efficiency compared to fixed solar panel
                            installations. Solar trackers, with their adaptability, are particularly effective in
                            maximizing electricity generation in varying environmental conditions.</li><br>

                            device widely used in hobbyist and small-scale electronics projects. It is a type of rotary
                            actuator that operates with precision and control. The SG90 is known for its affordability
                            and versatility, making it popular for applications such as model airplanes, cars, and
                            robotic projects. With a 180-degree range of motion, the SG90 is controlled by sending
                            electrical pulses to determine the desired position, and it includes a feedback mechanism to
                            ensure accurate positioning. Its small size, ease of use, and relatively low cost make the

                            electronic component that exhibits a change in resistance based on the intensity of light
                            falling on it. Also known as a photoresistor, the LDR's resistance decreases as the ambient
                            light level increases, and vice versa. This property makes it widely used in
                            light-sensitive applications, such as automatic streetlights, photography exposure control,
                            and ambient light detection in electronic devices. The LDR operates on the principle of the
                            photoconductivity effect, where the conductivity of the semiconductor material within the
                            sensor varies with light exposure. It is commonly employed as a simple and cost-effective
                            solution for detecting and responding to changes in light conditions in various electronic
                            and electrical systems.</li><br>
